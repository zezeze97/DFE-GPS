In this study, we introduce the Diagram Formalization Enhanced Geometry Problem Solver (DFE-GPS), a multi-modal architecture with three core components: a Diagram Formalizer, a Projection module, and a LLM. The LLM processes three types of inputs: diagram features $\mathcal{F}_{D}$ from the Diagram Encoder, formal diagram language representations (ConsCDL and ImgCDL) from the Diagram Formalizer, and natural language inputs containing problem statements and instructions. The Projection module aligns this information in the LLM's semantic space, enabling effective fusion. The LLM then refines the formal representations and generates reasoning steps for problem-solving. We used pre-trained [SigLIP-0.4B]() as the Vision Encoder, [Qwen2-0.5B-Instruct]() as the Lightweight LLM, and [Yi-1.5-Chat]() (9B or 34B) as the primary LLM. The training process is divided into three stages, all of which focus on auto-regressive generation tasks.
- **Stage 1**: The first stage focuses on training the Diagram Formalizer module, with training objective of generating formalized language descriptions corresponding to geometric diagrams. During this stage, all parameters of the Vision Encoder and part of the parameters of the Lightweight LLM (via the LoRA) are trainable to enhance the ability to extract visual features.
- **Stage 2**: The second stage emphasizes training the Projection modules, aligning vision feature $\mathcal{F}_{D}$ with the semantic space of the LLM by generating natural language descriptions and formalized language expressions for the geometric diagrams. During training, the parameters of the Diagram Encoder and LLM are frozen, with only the MLP parameters connecting the visual features and the language model being trainable.
- **Stage 3**: In the third stage, instruction fine-tuning enables the model to calibrate formalized diagram representations and solve problems. The input consists of geometric diagrams, formalized descriptions with random perturbations simulating Diagram Formalizer errors, and problem text accompanied by calibration and reasoning directives. The model learns to refine ConsCDL and ImgCDL, generating coherent natural language reasoning. During this phase, the parameters of the Diagram Encoder remain fixed, while the MLP and LLM parameters are trainable. Full parameter tuning is applied to the 9B model, whereas LoRA tuning is employed for the 34B model.

To find the measure of ∠BCD given that ∠DOB = 130° in a circle centered at O, here are the steps:

1. **Identify Key Points and Angles**:
   - O is the center of the circle.
   - Points D and B lie on the circle.
   - ∠DOB is the angle subtended by arc DB at the center of the circle.

2. **Determine the Measure of the Arc DB**:
   - Since ∠DOB (an angle at the center) is 130°, the arc DB across the circle opposite this angle also measures 130°.

3. **Relate Central Angle to Inscribed Angle**:
   - For any circle, an angle inscribed in the circle is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc. Here, ∠BCD is an inscribed angle that subtends the same arc DB as ∠DOB.

4. **Calculate ∠BCD**:
   - Given that ∠BCD subtends arc DB just like ∠DOB, and knowing the relationship between an inscribed angle and a central angle subtending the same arc:
     \[
     \text{Measure of } ∠BCD = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Measure of } ∠DOB = \frac{1}{2} \times 130° = 65°.
     \]
The final answer is: **65°**.

Let's examine and evaluate the student's answer against the reference answer.

##### Step 1: Reference Answer vs. Student's Answer

1. **Reference Answer Steps**:
   - States that ∠DOB = 130°.
   - Uses the property that an inscribed angle is half of the central angle that subtends the same arc.
   - Concludes that ∠BCD = 115°.

2. **Student's Answer Steps**:
   - States that ∠DOB = 130°.
   - Correctly identifies that arc DB also measures 130°.

##### Step 2: Review Each Reasoning Step

1. **Accuracy of Calculations**:
   - The student states that the measure of ∠BCD = ½ × 130° = 65°. This is **CALCULATIVELY INCORRECT** because the correct angle based on the inscribed angle theorem concerning arc DB from the reference answer equals 115°.
   - **Score**: 3/10

2. **Logical Reasoning**:
   - The student follows the logic of inscribed angles being half of the central angle correctly but fails to recognize that the inscribed angle ∠BCD relates to the opposite arc, which is not arc DB based on the provided context. Thus, while the reasoning about inscribed angles is applied, it’s based on a misunderstanding of the angles involved.
   - **Score**: 4/10

3. **Redundancy**:
   - The answer is somewhat concise but could clarify the connection to the arcs better. There are no unnecessary repetitions, thus this aspect seems properly managed.

Given the errors in calculation and identifying the angles involved in relation to arc DB, the final determination is categorized as:

**Score Summary**:
- Calculation Accuracy: 3/10
- Logical Reasoning: 4/10
- Redundancy: 8/10

#### Final Judgment: **INCORRECT**

#### Conclusion
The student's answer is incorrect because they arrived at the wrong measure for ∠BCD due to misapprehending the relationship between the angles and arcs. The final answer should be concluded as **115°** based on the reference answer and proper calculations related to circles.

**The final answer is: 115°.**

To find the measure of ∠BCD, we can use the fact that the sum of the angles around a point on a circle is 360 degrees. Since ∠DOB is an inscribed angle (an angle formed by two chords that have a common endpoint on the circle), the measure of ∠BCD is half the measure of ∠DOB.

**Step 1: Find the measure of ∠BCD.**
   - ∠BCD = (1/2) * ∠DOB

**Step 2: Plug in the given value for ∠DOB.**
   - ∠BCD = (1/2) * 130°

**Step 3: Calculate the value of ∠BCD.**
   - ∠BCD = 65°

Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180°, we have ∠BOD = 180° - ∠DOB = 180° - 130° = 50°.Since ∠BOD and ∠BCD are inscribed angles that intercept the same arc, they are congruent.\nTherefore, ∠BCD = ∠BOD = 50°. The measure of ∠BCD is ${50°}$. The answer is ${50}$.

#### LLM Evaluation
Let's break down both the reference answer and the student's answer step by step, focusing on the reasoning behind the computations to determine accuracy, logical reasoning, and potential redundancy.

##### Reference Answer Analysis:
1. **Given Information**: ∠DOB = 130° (1), O is the center of circle O (2).
2. **Using Inscribed Angle Theorem**: 
   - The angles in a cyclic quadrilateral (where points A, B, C, and D are concyclic) are such that opposite angles sum up to 180°. Hence, for angles BCD and ∠DBO: ∠BCD = -⌒OBD/2 + 180° (3). This shows the connection between the inscribed angle BCD and the central angle OBD.
3. **Establishing Relationships**:
   - By intuition or knowledge, we conclude ∠DOB = ⌒OBD (4), which means that the arc subtended by angle DOB is equal to angle DOB itself when considering the circle.
4. **Calculating Arc**: Using (1) and (4), we find ⌒OBD = 130° (5), leading to:
5. **Final Calculation**: Substituting (5) into (3) gives ∠BCD = 115° (6).
6. **Conclusion**: The measure of ∠BCD is concluded to be \( \boxed{115} \).

##### Student Answer Analysis:
1. **Initial Calculation**: The student believes ∠BOD = 180° - ∠DOB = 50°, which is somewhat relevant but ultimately misidentifies the relationships between angles.
2. **Misapplication of Angle Relationships**: The student incorrectly states that ∠BOD and ∠BCD are congruent due to them being inscribed angles intercepting the same arc. However, ∠BOD is a central angle, not an inscribed angle.
3. **Final Conclusion**: They conclude that ∠BCD = ∠BOD = 50°, which is incorrect as it misrepresents the geometry of the circle.

#### Step-by-Step Verification:
- **Reference Answer**:
   1. Correctly identifies all given information.
   2. Uses the inscribed angle theorem correctly.
   3. Correctly calculates arc degrees using the known angle.
   4. Correctly finds the inscribed angle measure.
   5. Overall, the calculations align and step through logically.

- **Student Answer**:
   1. The first step of calculating ∠BOD is calculated correctly but does not follow through with correctly understanding the relationships in the circle.
   2. The students’ logic that central angle BOD and inscribed angle BCD are equal is flawed.
   3. Misapplied reasoning leads to an incorrect conclusion.

#### Scores:
- **Calculation Accuracy**: 3/10 (The initial calculation of BOD was correct, but the final answer is wrong)
- **Logical Reasoning**: 3/10 (Misunderstanding of angle relationships leads to incorrect conclusions)
- **Redundancy**: 5/10 (Adequate logical flow but erroneous conclusion)

#### Final Judgment:
Considering the steps followed by the student contained substantial errors in reasoning about angle relationships, the overall judgment is:

**Final Judgment**: INCORRECT

#### Solution: Finding the Measure of ∠BCD Using Properties of Circles and Angles

##### Steps to Solution

1. **Identify Given Information**:
   - We are given that ∠DOB = 130°. Since ∠DOB is an inscribed angle, it is half the measure of the central angle subtended by the same arc.

2. **Determine the Central Angle**:
   - Let's denote the central angle subtended by arc BD as ∠BOD. Since ∠DOB is half of ∠BOD, we can calculate:
     \[
     ∠BOD = 2 \times ∠DOB = 2 \times 130° = 260°.
     \]

3. **Measure of Arc BD**:
   - Now, we need to find the measure of arc BD. Since the measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of the arc it subtends, the measure of arc BD is also 260°.

4. **Calculate Remaining Arc**:
   - Since arc BD is a part of the circle, the remaining part of the circle is:
     \[
     360° - 260° = 100°.
     \]

5. **Measure of ∠BCD**:
   - Since ∠BCD is an inscribed angle, it is half the measure of the arc it subtends. Therefore, the measure of ∠BCD is half of the remaining part of the circle:
     \[
     (1/2) \times 100° = 50°.
     \]

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Hence, the measure of ∠BCD is 50°.

##### Final Answer

The final answer is: **50°**

##### Step Verifications

1. **Step 1**: The student correctly identifies that ∠DOB = 130°.
   - **Assessment**: CORRECT

2. **Step 2**: The student claims that ∠BOD = 2 * ∠DOB = 2 * 130° = 260°.
   - **Assessment**: INCORRECT. The student misunderstands the relationship between ∠DOB and ∠BOD. Since ∠DOB is a central angle, we should utilize the relationship of inscribed angles. The correct reasoning would conclude that ∠BOD is not 260° as it exceeds 360° and does not correspond to the arc BD.

3. **Step 3**: Based on the previous incorrect step, the claim that the measure of arc BD is 260° cannot be validated.
   - **Assessment**: INCORRECT.

4. **Step 4**: The student calculates the remaining part of the circle as 100° (from the claim).
   - **Assessment**: INCORRECT. This is based on the previous incorrect interpretation of arc BD.

5. **Step 5**: The student states that ∠BCD = (1/2) * 100° = 50°.
   - **Assessment**: INCORRECT. Given all previous errors, this conclusion is also based on flawed logic.

6. **Step 6**: The student states the final answer as 50°.
   - **Assessment**: INCORRECT. The final answer is incorrect based on all preceding reasoning errors.

##### Scoring Summary

- **Calculation Accuracy**: 0/10 (All calculations are based on incorrect assumptions or errors).
- **Logical Reasoning**: 0/10 (The logical connections made are fundamentally flawed).
- **Redundancy**: 5/10 (While the steps follow a basic logical process, the reliance on incorrect math doesn’t add useful verbosity).

#### Final Judgment

Based on the evaluations of the reasoning and calculations:

**Final Judgment: INCORRECT**
